                The information we process depends on the features you use, your
                account type, and the services available in your location. A

              <p>
                Meaw uses privacy technologies to reduce unnecessary public
                exposure of payment information. These technologies do not
                guarantee anonymity or prevent all links between accounts,
                identities, and transactions. Information visible to Meaw or a
                service provider can differ from information visible on a public
                blockchain.

                The current Business Passport provides identity-verification
                status. This Policy does not describe an available revenue
                score, credit rating, business-quality grade, or portable
                cryptographically signed financial credential. Before
                introducing additional uses of personal data for such products,
                we will provide the relevant information and obtain consent
                where required.

                  When you undertake KYC or KYB verification, the configured

                  addresses, government identification details,

                  Sumsub collects and processes verification submissions through
                  the configured verification flow. Meaw receives and stores
                  verification metadata, including applicant and case
                  identifiers, status, check timestamps, rejection labels,
                  associated-person references and roles, and moderation
                  comments. Free-text comments may contain personal information.
                  Our integration may also receive applicant information while
                  retrieving and interpreting verification results, even when
                  only a smaller set of fields is retained in our operational

                  Documents and selfies submitted through Sumsub are handled in
                  its verification environment. This does not mean that Meaw
                  receives only a yes/no result or can never process information
                  contained in a verification case.

                  Where the selected verification process requires facial

                  facial images, video, and derived facial or biometric
                  information as described in the notices presented during
                  verification. The information collected depends on the

                <p>
                  Meaw does not use verification documents or biometric
                  information for advertising. Where separate consent is
                  required for biometric processing, it must be obtained before
                  that processing begins. Required notices explain the relevant

                  For the supported recovery flow, Meaw stores an encrypted
                  wallet recovery master together with the salt and
                  key-derivation parameters needed for recovery. The application
                  uses your recovery credentials to perform the relevant
                  cryptographic operations. Encrypted recovery material is still
                  sensitive information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The application also stores wallet owner and viewing secrets
                  in browser local storage for wallet functionality. Those
                  stored values are usable secret material and are not all
                  protected by an additional application-level encryption layer.
                  Browser storage may also contain preferences and cached wallet
                  information.

                An authorized owner or administrator can choose to publish an

                A published page is accessible to anyone with its link.

                Eligibility is reassessed over time. A passport may become

                Unpublishing removes public availability through Meaw&apos;s
                passport response; it does not delete internal verification

                independent customers, creditworthiness, business quality, or
                general legal compliance. Publishing it does not authorize
                publication of the business&apos;s entire financial history.

                safeguards. Where the preceding requirements cannot be met, the
                applicable consent requirements must be addressed before
                transfer. These are not interchangeable options chosen without

                We retain personal data for the period necessary for its stated
                purpose and any applicable, identified legal obligations.
                Retention is determined by category and trigger, rather than by
                an indefinite general need for compliance.
              </p>

              <p>
                If a specific legal hold requires longer retention, we limit it
                to the affected records and retain them for the applicable
                purpose and duration. Once retention is no longer justified, we
                delete or effectively anonymize the relevant information
                according to the applicable process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unpublishing or suspending a passport does not itself delete
                verification data. Deletion requests are assessed across
                Meaw&apos;s records and information processed on our behalf by
                providers. Provider-independent processing may require a
                separate request or explanation of the provider&apos;s
                obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Public blockchain records and copies independently retained by
                disclosure recipients are not generally deletable by Meaw. We
                explain these limits when responding to relevant requests.

                We use safeguards appropriate to the systems and information
                involved. The architecture includes encrypted recovery records
                and encrypted fields for some payment-session information, but
                this does not mean that every record is encrypted in every
                location or inaccessible to Meaw.

                No online service, device, or cryptographic system guarantees

                browser storage or deleting recovery information can affect
                access to wallet functionality; confirm that you have an
                appropriate recovery method before doing so.

                Configured verification processes use automated checks, which
                may include document checks, facial matching, liveness, and
                screening. Meaw also applies credential eligibility rules based
                on verification results and their freshness. These can prevent
                publication, require further information, or make an existing
                passport unavailable.

                If you believe a result or restriction is incorrect, contact{" "}
                <ContactLinks />. We will assess the request and provide the
                review and challenge mechanisms required by applicable law. A
                flag or failed check is not a public finding that you committed
                wrongdoing.

                portability, withdrawal of consent, or objection to certain
                processing. You may also have rights concerning decisions based
                solely on automated processing and the right to complain to a
                competent authority.
              </p>

                Send requests to <ContactLinks />. We may ask for proportionate
                information to verify your identity or authority to act for a
                business. We respond within the applicable legal period and
                explain any lawful limitations or retained categories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where processing relies on consent, you can withdraw that
                consent through the relevant control or by contacting us.
                Withdrawal does not invalidate prior lawful processing. It may
                affect the feature requiring that consent. Continued processing
                requires an independently applicable lawful basis; withdrawing
                consent is not a blanket authorization for indefinite retention.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can request that a passport be unpublished separately from
                requesting deletion of personal data.

                The Services use authentication/session technologies and browser
                storage for account and wallet functionality. Wallet storage
                includes the secrets described in Section 3, so its consequences
                extend beyond ordinary website preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Optional analytics or other non-essential technologies, if
                enabled, are described in the relevant notice and require
                consent where applicable. Browser controls may remove stored
                information, but doing so can sign you out or affect wallet
                access.
              </p>
              <p>
                Browser local storage holds wallet secrets, account references,
                cached wallet information, and your dashboard theme preference.
                It generally persists across browser sessions until removed by
                the application, you, or your browser. You can manage site data
                through your browser settings. Removing wallet data can affect
                access, so confirm your recovery method first.
