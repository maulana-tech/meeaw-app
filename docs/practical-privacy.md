# Mawee's Practical Privacy

We believe in **practical privacy** — enough to protect your normal financial
life, without pretending to be something it's not. So here's the straight talk on
what Mawee does and doesn't do.

## What Mawee provides

✅ **Unlinkable payments.** Nobody watching the blockchain can connect the money
coming in to the money you take out. Your deposits and withdrawals don't line up
in public.

✅ **A private balance.** Payments land as private notes only you can see and
spend. Your income isn't a public running total.

✅ **Hidden relationships.** Observers can't tell which client paid you, or that a
given payment belongs to you at all.

✅ **Simple links & QR codes.** Share a username instead of a scary wallet
address. Your clients don't need to understand any of this.

✅ **Proof when you want it.** You can voluntarily prove a specific payment
happened — for your accountant, your bank, or the tax office — without exposing
everything else.

## What Mawee doesn't provide

We're not a mixer, and we're not here to help anyone hide from legitimate
questions.

❌ **We don't hide the amount when you cash out.** When money *leaves* the private
pool, the withdrawal amount and destination are visible on the blockchain. What's
hidden is the *link* back to who paid you.

❌ **We don't obscure timing.** If you receive a payment and immediately withdraw
the exact same amount, someone could reasonably guess they're connected. Letting
funds rest, or withdrawing different amounts, keeps things cleaner.

❌ **We don't take custody on our servers.** Your passkey controls spending from
the on-chain pool, so Mawee's app and servers can't spend your funds. The pool's
2-of-3 governance can temporarily pause it during an emergency; sensitive
changes require 48 hours' public notice. Recovery still depends on your PIN and
passkey (see [Security & Recovery](security.md)).

❌ **We're not a tool for illicit activity.** Practical privacy means zero
sketchiness. Everyday people deserve financial privacy — that's the whole point.

## Traceability, on your terms

Here's the balance we strike: **private by default, provable by choice.**

Your day-to-day activity stays private. But when *you* need to show that a
specific payment happened — an audit, a tax filing, a "please prove this deposit"
from your bank — Mawee lets you export a disclosure for just that one payment.
Everything else stays private.

That's the difference between privacy and secrecy. You're never stuck unable to
account for your own money.
